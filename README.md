# Property Renovation Company Website

This website is developed for a property renovation company, utilizing the power and flexibility of [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) with TypeScript and SCSS. The project is bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app), leveraging these technologies to ensure a robust, scalable, and stylish foundation for showcasing our renovation projects, services, and company information.

## Getting Started

To run the development server, execute one of the following commands:

- `npm run dev`
- `yarn dev`
- `pnpm dev`

Visit [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser to view the project live. As you make changes to `pages/index.tsx`, you'll see the updates in real-time. This instant feedback loop is ideal for development, allowing for rapid iteration.

### API Routes

Our website utilizes Next.js's [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) feature for dynamic data fetching and server-side operations. The sample endpoint at [http://localhost:3000/api/hello](http://localhost:3000/api/hello) (`pages/api/hello.ts`) demonstrates how to implement and customize these routes for your needs.

### TypeScript

TypeScript is used throughout this project to provide static type checking and enhance code quality and maintainability. This powerful addition to our development workflow ensures that we can catch errors early and maintain a high standard of code across the project.

### SCSS

We've chosen SCSS for styling our application due to its powerful features like variables, nesting, and mixins that make our CSS more maintainable and easier to write. This allows us to craft unique, responsive designs that perfectly fit the needs of our property renovation company's branding and user experience.

### Font Optimization

We've implemented [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to optimize and serve the Inter font, enhancing our website's visual appeal and readability without compromising performance.
